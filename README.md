Welcome to the github repository for my personal website! I programmed this app with Next.js and React.js. I styled it using a combination of bootstrap and custom CSS. 

## Getting Started

To host my website locally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
