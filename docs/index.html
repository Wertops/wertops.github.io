ABC2 started in my home county of Halifax County. I gave a presentation at ABC2’s conference a few years ago about racial inequity in the solar industry, and how the expansion of solar could be an opportunity to help close that gap in rural areas like Halifax county. After that presentation, they really honored me by asking if I’d be a member of their board to help inform and guide the climate work they were getting into. I joined their board in 2021. I wasn’t able to be active on the board for a while because I was struggling with a lot of mental health issues during my last two years of college. Now that I am functioning well again and have graduated, I am active on the board again.</p></section></div></div></div><div class="container-flex"><div class="row my-5"><div class="col"><section class="utils_headingMd__XQE5B"><h1>Intern at C4EE</h1></section><section class="utils_text__gqryZ"><p>The Center for Energy Education (C4EE) is a nonprofit whose goal is to make the solar industry better work for the communities that host solar farms. They train people to become solar installers and run education programs for local people on solar energy. I was the first intern at C4EE back in 2018. I regularly updated the social media pages, compiled a list of over 300 people to invite to C4EE’s grand opening, and helped run C4EE’s original summer camps and teacher trainings. I came back as an intern in the summer of 2020. I also have maintained a relationship with C4EE through the years, and have occasionally helped with their programs as recently as 2023. </p></section></div><div class="col"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="img-responsive position-relative start-0" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/_next/static/media/c4eebuilding.336c5b0e.png"/></div></div></div><div class="container-flex"><div class="row my-5"><div class="col"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="img-responsive position-relative start-0" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/_next/static/media/NREL Logo.95999294.png"/></div><div class="col"><section class="utils_headingMd__XQE5B"><h1>Cybersecurity Research Intern at NREL</h1></section><section class="utils_text__gqryZ"><p>I was honored to be selected or the Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship at the National Renewable Energy Lab.

Sadly, Covid hit right before I was supposed to start my internship, so I had to complete this internship remotely. While I didn’t have the experience I’d expected, it was exciting to learn about the awesome work that goes on at this national lab, and learn a bit about energy grid cybersecurity in the process.</p></section></div></div></div><div class="container-flex"><div class="row my-5"><div class="col"><section class="utils_headingMd__XQE5B"><h1>Climate Change Activist at UNC</h1></section><section class="utils_text__gqryZ"><p>I’ve cared deeply about climate change and how it stands to impact the world since my Mom took me to watch the inconvenient truth when I was a kid. I vowed to myself in the 5th grade that I must figure out a way to stop climate change by 2016. Obviously, I wasn’t succesful in that goal. By my sophomore year of college, however, I was increasingly disillusioned with the more mainstream routes of advocacy championed as ways to combat climate change like by calling elected officials, recycling, and composting. I joined the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate advocacy group, to try and fight for more rapid climate action. I also started sitting outside UNC’s administrative building in a climate change protest every Friday to demand UNC create a time bound sustainability plan. Once Covid hit, I moved to Warren County, NC. I helped start and run a Sunrise Movement Chapter there. </p></section></div><div class="col"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="img-responsive position-relative start-0" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/_next/static/media/climateprotest.87d44685.png"/></div></div></div><div class="container-flex"><div class="row my-5"><div class="col"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" class="img-responsive position-relative start-0" style="position:absolute;height:100%;width:100%;left:0;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;object-fit:cover;color:transparent" src="/_next/static/media/Steelcasephoto.4089f2f7.png"/></div><div class="col"><section class="utils_headingMd__XQE5B"><h1>Software Engineering Intern at Steelcase</h1></section><section class="utils_text__gqryZ"><p>During the summer of 2018-2019, I had my first ever software engineering internship at Steelcase. Steelcase creates supportive and beautiful offices and office furniture. I worked on Steelcase’s legacy code, most of which was written in ABAP. Learning ABAP was particularly challenging because most of the variable names were not readable, and many of the functions that I needed to be familiar with were Steelcase specific. Thus, there was no online documentation.  I did manage to develop a new version of one of their apps to replace an older version by the end of my internship. </p></section></div></div></div></div></section></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"ZkQiutV4zdFjZdW2l2niv","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
